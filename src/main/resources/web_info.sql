A system can be considered as a collection of entities and their interrelationships gathered together to form a whole greater than the sum of the entities. It also involves people, organizations, cultures, activities and interrelationships among them. While systems composed of autonomous subsystems are not new, increased data density, connectivity and ubiquitous computational resources have increased their interdependence and interaction complexity. This has in turn made the job of planning, developing and deploying complex systems even more difficult.<br />\r\nThe International Conference on Systems Science and Engineering 2017 (ICSSE 2017) will take place in Ho Chi Minh City during July 21-23, 2017. This event will provide scholars, experts, engineers and practitioners from all over the world with a great opportunity for to present the latest system design concepts, research results, developments and applications, as well as to facilitate interactions between scholars and practitioners. ICSSE 2017 will feature plenary speeches in emerging technology topics given by world renowned scholars. The proceedings of ICSSE 2017 will be published by the IEEE with EI- indexing. In addition, selected high-quality papers will be published by special issues of SCI-indexed journals. Best paper awards will be given to those with outstanding achievements.<br />\r\nThe conference welcomes all submission of original research papers in all aspects of system science and engineering. To broaden the scope and promote participant, organized sessions will also be welcomed and incorporated into the ICSSE 2017 program.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p><strong>-&nbsp;Biological systems and Evolution<br />\r\n			- Communication Systems<br />\r\n			- Decision Support System Modeling and Techniques&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Decision and Control Systems<br />\r\n			- E-Commerce Systems<br />\r\n			- Energy Saving&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Fuzzy Systems, Soft Computing and Grey Systems<br />\r\n			- Human Systems&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Industrial Organization and Management<br />\r\n			- Information and System Engineering&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Integrated Automation Technology Applications<br />\r\n			- Intelligent Systems<br />\r\n			- Medical and Health Systems&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Novel Applications of Systems Engineering<br />\r\n			- Optimization&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Power systems</strong></p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p><strong>- Other disciplines in System Engineering<br />\r\n			- Smart Grid&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- System Engineering Language&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Systems Application in Business and Industry<br />\r\n			- Systems Architecting<br />\r\n			- Systems Complexity&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Systems Engineering Management Process&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Systems Engineering Technical &amp; Support Process<br />\r\n			- Systems Modeling, Tools and Simulation&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Systems Risk Management&nbsp;<br />\r\n			- Systems Safety and Security<br />\r\n			- Systems Science and Cybernetics<br />\r\n			- Traffic Science and Engineering<br />\r\n			- IoT in Education and Industry<br />\r\n			- Renewable Energy</strong></p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"background-color:#f39c12\">IMPORTANT DEADLINES:</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 pages extended Abstract Submission</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 30, 2017: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notification of Acceptance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2-6 Pages Final Papers Submission</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 30, 2017: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Online Registration</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>SUBMISSION POLICIES:</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSubmitted papers should be written in English.

Located around 50 kilometres north of Ho Chi Minh City, it is essentially a preserved network of tunnels where you will be able to get a good understanding of what life was like for the Viet Cong during the war. This is one section of the larger Cu Chi Tunnels network. It takes around an hour to drive from the city centre. Most people visit Ben Dinh Tunnels as part of a tour, and spend two to three hours learning about the life of the North Vietnamese and exploring a specially designed (and widened) section of the tunnels for yourself. Accompanied by a guide, you will walk through the forest and be given extensive details about the place, which makes it easy for you to paint a picture of back in the days.

Here, you&rsquo;ll find eating stalls inside the market where you can get a taste of hawker-style Vietnamese cuisine or simply cool off with a cold drink when the bargaining becomes too much. The market is big, difficult to navigate at times and certainly best avoided during the hottest part of the day but all the same its well worth a look. When night falls, restaurants around the perimeter of the market open their doors creating a vibrant street side scene filling the air with the scents of wok-fried noodles, barbecued fish and meats. One of Saigon&rsquo;s oldest landmarks, Ben Thanh offers a great atmosphere that is absolutely authentically Vietnamese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market/allParagraphs/01/image/ben-thanh-market-side.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSave your appetite and head to Ben Thanh Market in the evening where you can be served some real street style local food at one of the 20 or so eateries that surround the market building. Chefs will cook in front of you with an endless array of cuisine choices including vegetarian noodles, fresh seafood, crispy rice pancakes and steamed cakes. You will be in great local company as most of the places thrive with locals enjoying a bite to eat and a quick drink on their way home from work.

Located in Paris Square, the name Notre Dame was given after the installation of the statue &lsquo;Peaceful Notre Dame&rsquo; in 1959. In 1962, the Vatican conferred the Cathedral status as a basilica and gave it the official name of Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Measuring almost 60 metres in height, the cathedral&rsquo;s distinctive neo-Romanesque features include the all-red brick fa&ccedil;ade (which were imported from Marseille), stained glass windows, two bell towers containing six bronze bells that still ring to this day, and a peaceful garden setting in the middle of downtown Ho Chi Minh City District 1.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/vietnam/homepage/ho-chi-minh-city/notre-dame-cathedral/allParagraphs/0/image/notre-dame-cathedral-01.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Virgin Mary statue also stands in front of Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral, which locals claimed to have shed tears in October 2005. While this incident was refuted by the Catholic Church of Vietnam, thousands of visitors still flock to this statue in hopes of witnessing a miracle. &nbsp; Aside from its status as one of Ho Chi Minh City&rsquo;s most prominent attractions, Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral still serves as a religious institution for the local population.

This image is one of the most famous pictures depicting the Reunification Palace which has seen a rich and varied history and once served as the base of the US-backed Vietnamese General Ngo Dinh Diem during the Vietnam War, until his assassination in 1963. The palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975 with two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Originally the site of the Nordom Palace also known as the Governor&rsquo;s Palace its first role was as a home and workplace for the then French Governor of Cochinchina. The Reunification Palace is a landmark not to be missed by any tourist visiting Ho Chi Minh City. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the palace hides secret rooms, antique furniture and a command bunker within its eerie corridors.

A system can be considered as a collection of entities and their interrelationships gathered together to form a whole greater than the sum of the entities. It also involves people, organizations, cultures, activities and interrelationships among them. While systems composed of autonomous subsystems are not new, increased data density, connectivity and ubiquitous computational resources have increased their interdependence and interaction complexity. This has in turn made the already difficult job of planning, developing and deploying complex systems even more difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;Technology advancement not only provides opportunities for improving system capabilities but also introduces development risks that must be weighed and managed. Thus, it is our goal to bring together scholars from all areas to have a forum to discuss, demonstrate and exchange research ideas in the scope of system science and engineering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;The International Conference on Systems Science and Engineering 2017 (ICSSE 2017) is an international conference that will take place in Ho Chi Minh City during July 21-23, 2017. This event will provide a great opportunity for scientists, engineers, and practitioners from all over the world to present the latest system design concepts, research results, developments and applications, as well as to facilitate interactions between scholars and practitioners. ICSSE 2017 will feature plenary speeches in emerging technology topics given by world renowned scholars. The proceedings of ICSSE 2017 will be published by the IEEE with EI indexing.
